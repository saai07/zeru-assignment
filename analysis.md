## Wallet Credit Score Analysis
#Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates wallet behavior in the Aave V2 protocol using unsupervised machine learning to assign credit scores (0-1000). Higher scores indicate reliable users, while lower scores signal risky behavior. The Isolation Forest algorithm identified key behavioral patterns that strongly correlate with credit risk.
